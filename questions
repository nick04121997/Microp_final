-- How to do SPI on the pi to the FPGA but have the FPGA queue when the data is ready?

-- Is the SCLK only going when we call spiSendReceive? 

-- Do we need to actually send anything over for SPI? 
	- Current structure seems to not need MOSI at the moment.

-- How to have counter increment only when we receive data?

-- General Verilog structure for the SPI module as well as current state machine.

done writing flag goes to pi, have the read_adr counter be incremented on the pi sclk
